# 🚀 Harwest Setup Guide - For Fork Users!

**Welcome to Harwest! Setting up your fork is quick and easy.**

This guide will help you set up Harwest to automatically harvest your competitive programming submissions using GitHub Actions.

## ⏱️ Setup Time: 3-5 Minutes

## 📋 What You Need

- A GitHub account
- Your competitive programming username(s):
  - **Codeforces**: Your handle (e.g., "tourist")
  - **AtCoder**: Your handle (e.g., "rng_58")

---

## 🎯 Setup Methods

### ⚡ Method 1: Automated Setup Script (Recommended)

The fastest way to set up your fork:

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Go to: https://github.com/MishkatIT/harwest-tool
   - Click the **"Fork"** button
   - Wait for GitHub to create your fork

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/harwest-tool.git
   cd harwest-tool
   ```

3. **Run Setup Script**
   
   **For new fork users:**
   ```bash
   python setup_fork.py
   ```
   
   **For fresh start (existing users):**
   ```bash
   python reset_repository.py
   ```
   
   The script will:
   - ✅ Clear old user's data
   - ✅ Ask for your Codeforces username
   - ✅ Ask for your AtCoder username
   - ✅ Configure git author info (for contribution graph)
   - ✅ Initialize empty markdown files
   
4. **Push Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure fork for personal use"
   git push
   ```

5. **Enable GitHub Actions**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click **"Actions"** tab
   - Click **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**

✅ **Done!** Your fork is ready.

### 📝 Method 2: Manual Setup (No Programming Required)

If you prefer to do it through GitHub web interface:

### Step 1: Fork and Clean Repository (30 seconds)

1. Go to: https://github.com/MishkatIT/harwest-tool
2. Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner
3. Select your GitHub account
4. **Important**: Delete old user's data
   - Go to `submissions/` folder
   - Delete old submission files (optional, they'll be replaced)
   - Or just leave them - they'll be ignored once you configure your username

✅ **Done!** You now have your own copy of Harwest.

---

### Step 2: Add Your Usernames (1 minute)

Now tell Harwest which accounts to harvest from:

1. In **your forked repository**, click on: `config/users.json`
2. Click the **✏️ (pencil/edit)** icon in the top-right
3. Replace the content with your usernames:

```json
{
  "codeforces": ["YourCodeforcesHandle"],
  "atcoder": ["YourAtCoderHandle"]
}
```

**Real Example:**
```json
{
  "codeforces": ["tourist"],
  "atcoder": ["rng_58"]
}
```

**📝 Notes:**
- Replace `YourCodeforcesHandle` with your actual username
- Use your **exact** username (case-sensitive!)
- Don't use a platform? Leave it empty: `"atcoder": []`
- Multiple usernames? Add them: `"codeforces": ["handle1", "handle2"]`

4. Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"**
5. In the popup, click **"Commit changes"** again

✅ **Done!** Harwest now knows which accounts to harvest from.

---

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Actions (30 seconds)

Make the automation work:

1. Click the **"Actions"** tab at the top of your repository
2. You'll see: *"Workflows aren't being run on this forked repository"*
3. Click the green button: **"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"**

✅ **Done!** GitHub Actions is now enabled and will start harvesting automatically.

---

## 🎉 That's It! You're All Set!

GitHub Actions will now:
- ✅ Run **automatically every day** at 11:20 PM BDT (5:20 PM UTC)
- ✅ Harvest your latest submissions from Codeforces and AtCoder

## 📊 (Optional) Show Contributions in Your GitHub Graph

Want your submissions to appear as contributions on your GitHub profile?

1. Go to your fork: **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **Variables** tab
2. Click **"New repository variable"**
3. Add:
   - **Name**: `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`
   - **Value**: Your GitHub email (the one you use for GitHub)
4. Click **"Add variable"**

**Important:** Use the same email that's verified in your GitHub account settings.

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration (Optional)

Most users can skip this section. The defaults work great!

### Custom Settings

Want to customize? Add these variables in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**:

| Variable | What it does | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` | Your name in commits | `GitHub Actions` |
| `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` | Your email in commits (use GitHub email!) | `actions@github.com` |
| `SUBMISSIONS_DIR` | Where submissions are stored | `./submissions` |

### Schedule Behavior

- **Active**: Runs daily when you're solving problems
- **Inactive 30+ days**: Automatically switches to monthly (1st of month)
- **Resume activity**: Automatically switches back to daily
- **Manual trigger**: Always available anytime

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### ❌ No submissions appearing?

**Check 1: Is your username correct?**
- Open `config/users.json` in your fork
- Verify your username exactly matches your actual handle
- Check for typos and correct capitalization

**Check 2: Did the workflow run?**
- Go to **Actions** tab
- Look for green ✓ checkmarks
- If red ❌, click it to see the error

**Check 3: Are Actions enabled?**
- Go to **Actions** tab
- Should show workflow runs
- If empty, repeat Step 3 of setup

### ❌ Contributions not showing in graph?

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**
2. Check that `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` matches your GitHub account email
3. Verify email in **GitHub Settings → Emails**
4. Email must be verified ✓

### ❌ Workflow is failing?

**Common Issues:**

1. **"No username configured"**
   - Edit `config/users.json` and add your username
   
2. **"Rate limiting"**
   - Codeforces/AtCoder may be temporarily limiting requests
   - Wait 10-15 minutes and try again
   - The workflow will retry automatically tomorrow

3. **Permission error**
   - Make sure GitHub Actions is enabled (Step 3)
   - Check Actions tab for specific error messages

**Debug Steps:**
1. Go to failed workflow run in **Actions** tab
2. Click on the red ❌ job
3. Read the error message (usually very clear!)
4. Fix the issue and run workflow again

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **First Run**: Manually trigger with "Full scan" checked for complete history
2. **Be Patient**: First run may take 5-10 minutes if you have many submissions
3. **Private Fork**: You can make your fork private if you prefer
4. **Multiple Accounts**: Track friends/teams by adding multiple usernames
5. **Manual Trigger**: Use "Run workflow" anytime to harvest immediately
